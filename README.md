A few years after I graduated high school, my former high school golf coach contacted me and said, "I wish I could get my golfers Strokes Gained Data. Do you know anything about that?"

Strokes Gaines is an innovative golf statistic invented a few years ago by professor Mark Broadie at Columbia University. It completely changed the way golfers played and practiced.

My coach wanted to get his players good data, but all of the apps and tools sold online costed hundreds of dollars.

Lucky for my coach, I had already read a book written by Mark Broadie about Strokes Gained, and I knew how to calculate it.

I spent a few nights putting this spreadsheet together, and his golfers have been using it after every round for the last couple of seasons.
